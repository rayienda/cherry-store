Because django supports rapid development and follows practices like the MVT architecture. It allows beginner developers to understand fundamental concepts like routin, templating, and database management without having to worrying about more codes. Django also has large and well-organized documentation, making it easier for beginners to find information and learn how to use the framework effectively.
